# Diabetes Dataset Analysis

This project involves cleaning and analyzing a diabetes dataset to gain insights into patient health and risk factors.
The analysis was performed using Python, and the cleaned dataset is included alongside the original for reproducibility.

# Key features include:
Glucose Levels
Blood Pressure
BMI
Insulin Levels
Age

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two main parts:
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - The raw dataset (`diabetes.csv`) contains inconsistent values.
   - Cleaning steps include handling missing data, correcting errors, and standardizing formats.
   - The cleaned dataset (`diabetes_cleaned.csv`) is included for further analysis.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed on the cleaned dataset.
   - Key insights were derived, and visualizations were created to highlight trends and patterns.
